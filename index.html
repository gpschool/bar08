<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>To register for the workshop click <a href="./registration1.php">here</a>.<p>The workshop will provide a forum to discuss Bayesian inference in machine learning. A particular focus will be on how Bayesian inference can be used to encode prior knowledge. 

<p>The workshop is part of the PASCAL FP7 <a href="http://inverseprobability.com/thematic08.html">Thematic Programme</a> on "Leveraging Complex Prior Knowledge for Learning".

The workshop is now over. This page is maintained as a record of the workshop with links to slides and videos of the talks.

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>The main aim of this workshop is to allow leading Bayesian researchers in machine learning to get together presenting their latest ideas and discussing future directions. 

<h3>Themes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Incorporating Complex Prior Knowledge in Bayesian inference, for example mechanistic models (such as differential equations) or knowledge transfered from other related situations (e.g. hierarchical Dirichlet Processes). </li>
<li>Model mismatch: the Bayesian lynch pin is that the model is correct, but it rarely is.</li>
<li>Approximation techniques: how should we do Bayesian inference in practice. Sampling, variational, Laplace or something else?</li>
<li>Your pet Bayesian issue here.</li>
</ul>
